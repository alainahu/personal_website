title: "About me"
---

My name is Alaina, and I am a third-year student at the University of Toronto. 
I am studying economics, psychology, and statistics. I am passionate about problem-solving and relationship-building. Through my academic courses, personal
projects, and extracurriculars, I have been able to grow my skills in these
areas. In my free time, I love spending time with friends, listening to music,
or exercising.
